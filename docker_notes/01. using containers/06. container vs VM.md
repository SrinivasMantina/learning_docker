# **Container vs Virtual Machine**

Containers are often compared to Virtual Machines, but they aren't. Here's the architecture

**Virtual Machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system**
 * Virtual Machine makes it possible to run what appear to be many separate computers on hardware that is actually one computer
 * The operating systems (OS) and their applications share hardware resources from a single host server, or from a pool of host servers
 * Each VM requires its own underlying OS, and the hardware is virtualized
 * A hypervisor (or a virtual machine monitor) is software that creates and runs VMs. It sits between the hardware and the virtual machine and is necessary to virtualize the server

**With containers, instead of virtualizing the underlying computer like a virtual machine (VM), just the OS is virtualized**
 * Container is an isolated, lightweight process of an application running on host OS 
 * They have limited resources like CPU, memory
 * Sharing OS resources such as libraries significantly reduces the need to reproduce the OS code
 * Containers exit when the process stops
