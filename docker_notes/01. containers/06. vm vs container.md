# **Virtual Machine vs Container**

Containers are often compared to Virtual Machines, but they aren't. Here's the architecture

**Virtual Machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system**
 * Virtual Machine makes it possible to run what appear to be many separate computers on hardware that is actually one computer
 * The operating systems (OS) and their applications share hardware resources from a single host server, or from a pool of host servers
 * Each VM requires its own underlying OS, and the hardware is virtualized
 * A hypervisor (or a virtual machine monitor) is software that separates resources from their physical machines so they can be partitioned and dedicated to VMs

**With containers, instead of virtualizing the underlying computer like a virtual machine (VM), just the OS is virtualized**
 * Container is an isolated, lightweight process of an application running on host OS 
 * They have limited resources like CPU, memory
 * Containers hold a microservice or app and everything (binaries, libraries and dependencies) it needs to run.
 * Sharing OS resources such as libraries significantly reduces the need to reproduce the OS code
 * Containers exit when the process stops
